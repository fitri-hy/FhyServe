## Tunnels

Tunnels is a feature in FhyServe that allows local services (localhost) to be exposed to the public network through a temporary URL using Localtunnel technology.

With Tunnels, developers can:

* Access local services from outside the network
* Test webhooks
* Demo applications to clients without deployment
* Integrate external APIs that require a public endpoint

---

## Technologies Used

* Localtunnel
* Protocol: HTTP / HTTPS
* Connection model: Reverse tunnel
* URLs are ephemeral

---

## How It Works

1. The local service runs on a specific port (e.g., `localhost:3000`)
2. Localtunnel establishes an outbound connection to the tunnel server
3. The tunnel server provides a public URL
4. Requests to the public URL are forwarded to the local port

---

## Tunnel Information Structure

Each active tunnel displays the following information:

| Field | Description |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **PORT** | Exposed local port |
| **STATUS** | Tunnel status (`RUNNING`, `STOPPED`, `ERROR`) |
| **URL** | Public URL generated by Localtunnel |
| **PUBLICIP** | Public IP of the tunnel server |

---

## Endpoints & Tunnel Access

An active tunnel can be accessed via:

```
https://<generated-subdomain>.loca.lt
```

> The URL will change each time the tunnel is stopped and restarted (unless using a custom subdomain).

---

## Adding a New Tunnel

FhyServe provides an **Add Tunnel** form to create and manage tunnels directly from the UI.

### Access Flow

Home → Tunnels → Add Tunnel**

---

### Add Tunnel Form

| Field | Description |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Local Port** | Local port to be exposed |

---

## Tunnel Status

| Status | Description |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `RUNNING` | Tunnel is active and accessible |
| `STOPPED` | Tunnel is stopped |
| `ERROR` | Failure occurred during initialization |

---

## Tunnel Management

Users can:

* Run a tunnel
* Stop a tunnel
* Delete a tunnel
* View the URL and public IP
* Restart the tunnel

Access via the **Tunnels Dashboard**.

## Technical Notes

* Ensure the local port is **running**
* One port can only be used by one tunnel
* Tunnels are **non-persistent**
* Not recommended for production use
* Performance depends on internet connection
